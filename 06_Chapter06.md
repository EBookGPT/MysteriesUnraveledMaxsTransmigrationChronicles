# The Mystery of the Cursed Tomb

As Sapphire Sleuth, Max and Conan found themselves transmigrated into Ancient Egypt, standing at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. They had been summoned by the local chief inspector to investigate a series of strange occurrences surrounding the tomb of the great pharaoh. Locals were convinced that the tomb was cursed, as anyone who dared to enter never emerged.

Upon arriving at the site, Max and Conan were met by an apprehensive archeologist who had been overseeing the excavation. He recounted the bizarre occurrences that had transpired over the past few weeks, including disappearing relics and unexplained noises emanating from the tomb.

Max and Conan began their investigation by examining the tomb's entrance. They quickly discovered that several traps had been set to prevent entry, but were expertly disabled. As they descended into the depths of the tomb, they encountered even more intricate traps, such as rolling boulders and poison darts, which seemed to activate automatically.

Deeper into the tomb, they discovered several artifacts had been moved, and a mysterious symbol had been etched into the wall. As they deciphered the hieroglyphics, they realized that it was a warning against disturbing the pharaoh's final resting place, or else suffer the curse of the gods.

Suddenly, they heard a low growling sound and realized that they were not alone. A tomb raider emerged from the shadows, wielding a machete and intent on claiming the treasures that lay within. A fierce battle ensued, with Max and Conan using their martial arts skills to disable the tomb raider.

As they continued to explore the tomb, they discovered a room filled with a strange light, emanating from a crystal orb. They realized that the orb was the source of the tomb's curse, appearing to be a conjuration spell meant to ward off potential graverobbers.

With great effort and skill, Max and Conan incapacitated the spell, causing the crystal orb to shatter and the curse to be lifted. The chief inspector quickly arrived, and, amazed by their prowess, sent a team to finish the excavation of the tomb.
